Notes concerning the protocol for communicating with the relay daemon.

Just a collection of ideas at this point.

Background:
Two major connections to be concerned with for now:  The Service Connection and the Relay Connection.
This version of the daemon uses Numato Ethernet Relays with telnet connection.  So this connection is pretty well defined by the company already.

Relay Connection:
-Telnet.
-Defined on numato website.
-simple ascii commands over telnet.

Service Connection:
-RabbitMQ
